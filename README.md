# Uber-Data-Engineering-Analysis

A complete data engineering project with Google Cloud, Big Query and Locker Studio.

Using Mage-ai I load the data from Google Cloud, transformed them and finally exported them to BigQuery. Finally with Locker studio an interactive dashboard is created that can be visited [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/fabb24d7-51d5-4481-81ed-40639e9f0f75). 

The entire project was realised thanks to Darshil Parmar and his [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQECq5Hx9g&t=3029s).
